Library Used for taking argument in python file
argparse

Explatination : Using this library we define what are all parameters we can take as an argument and thnn we can perform action based on it.

Installation Process:
Need to install python3 for executing this script , we can install python3 using below command:
sudo apt install
sudo apt install python3

Now we can execute our script using below command and pass argument as well.
python3 -m pyls -t

python3 --> This is python with version, if python2.x is installed than we can mention "python" instead of  "python3"
pyls --> This is based on file name, where file name is pyls.py
-t --> argument, which we have defined in file also.
